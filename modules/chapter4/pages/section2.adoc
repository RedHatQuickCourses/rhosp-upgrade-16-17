= Validating your SSH Key Size

Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 9.1 requires a minimum SSH key size of 2048 bits. You must check that your current SSH key on Red Hat OpenStack Platform (RHOSP) director has a key of at least 2048 bits. If you do not have an SSH key that meets the requirements of RHEL 9.x, you can lose access to the overcloud.

*Procedure:*

You must complete this procedure if your SSH key size is under the required 2048 bits.

. Validate your SSH key size:
+
[source, bash]
----
ssh-keygen -l -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
----
+
Example output:
+
----
1024 SHA256:Xqz0Xz0/aJua6B3qRD7VsLr6n/V3zhmnGSkcFR6FlJw stack@director.example.local (RSA)
----

. If your SSH key is less than 2048 bits, use the ssh_key_rotation.yaml ansible playbook to rotate it out.
+
[source, bash]
----
ansible-playbook -i ~/overcloud-deploy/overcloud/tripleo-ansible-inventory.yaml /usr/share/ansible/tripleo-playbooks/ssh_key_rotation.yaml -e keys_folder=/home/stack/.ssh -e key_name=id_rsa
